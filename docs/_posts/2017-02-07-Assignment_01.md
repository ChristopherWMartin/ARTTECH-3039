1. Bookkeeping!
  - None
3. Read and Work Examples [Image Processing and Computer Vision](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html)
  - Please read second half after [Point Processing Operations ...](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html#pointprocessingoperationsonimages)
4. Code
    - Review instructions for submitting your code assignment [here](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3039-Spring-2017-Private/blob/master/README.md).
    - Prepare you fork, and complete `Assignment_01_00` using [my source](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3039-Spring-2017-Private/tree/master/bakercp/Assignment_01_00/src) as a starting point.
    - Read all source code in the example, including comments. Do your best to understand the structure. Pay special attention to:
      - The use of functions to make logical groups in the code.
      - The use of `ofxGui` to create simple sliders and toggles.
      - The custom `ConvexHull` class.
      - Note that a Particle system is in the code, but not currently used. Feel free to use it ...
    - Experiment with [EXAMPLE](https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/ARTTECH-3039-Spring-2017-Private/blob/master/bakercp/Assignment_01_00/src/ofApp.cpp#L72-L106) section and answer inline questions and submit your assignment using a pull request.
