## Course Description
Computer vision allows machines to see and understand their environment. This course will equip students with the practical skills and critical theory needed to both employ and critically engage these techniques. Real-time body tracking, facial recognition and gesture analysis using RGB+D and LiDAR sensors, artificial intelligence and machine learning will be emphasized. Students will explore and critique contemporary applications ranging from automated mass surveillance to interactive installations. A final project will build on in-class workshops, technical exercises, critical readings and discussions.

## Course Goals
- Working and applied knowledge "classical" computer vision techniques.
- Working and applied knowledge of modern computer vision techniques that leverage machine learning.

## Course Values
- Sharing / Open
    - Documentation
    - [DIWO](http://furtherfield.org/projects/diwo-do-it-others-resource)
    - Publish
    - [Cult of Done](http://www.brepettis.com/blog/2009/3/3/the-cult-of-done-manifesto.html)

## Methodology
Students will engage in individual in-lab and home assignments, class presentations, lectures, discussions, assigned readings, group and individual projects and desk critiques. Visiting artists / faculty may enhance the experience and offer additional perspectives.

## Assignments
The course may include workshops and several projects, relevant technical and theoretical reading, written online responses, technical research and outings.
